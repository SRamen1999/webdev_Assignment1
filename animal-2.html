        Octopus are animals that live in the ocean. They have eight arms and a head. 
        They have three hearts and blue blood. To stop predators they are able to squirt ink.
        Another fun fact about octopus is that they are able to squeeze through tight spaces due to them
        being boneless and slimy. Not only that octopus are very intelligent.
